At my current org work culture is nice and I have seen hardly anyone left in my team in last 4 years.
One of the reason for this is the management style which I call macro management.
I am trying to write down what is it and how it works.

The goal of macro management is below
- Creating a non interruptive environment where people can do deep work which they enjoy.
- Enable autonomy so people can take most of the decision they need themselves.
- Build transparency so everyone know which direction we are heading.

Below are the things leads/managers DONT do
- Asking for an update
- Creating agenda less meetings
- Telling what to do or how to do

Instead these are the things they do
 - Have a very good onboarding setup for new people, let them know the nuances in the system so they feel confident to make the changes
 - Making all process transparent so everyone's work is visible, this avoids asking for udpates and daily stand ups
 - Minimal meetings and lean process. Meetings are recorded so people can skip them if they want
 - All the communication happens in open slack channels, so people know the reasons behind the decisions.
 - Regular 1:1 so there is space to discuss/share things
 - Leading by example of doing higher quality of work
 - No blame culture, when things go wrong focus is on what went wrong and how to prevent this in future.
 - Encourage people to take long vacations so they disconnect and richarge fully.
 - Slack culture where you encouraged to mute all the notificaitons
 - Regular feedback collection by tools like officevibe
